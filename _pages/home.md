title: "About Me"

Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences
at the University of Texas at Austin, working under the direction of Catherine
Calder. I am passionate about science communication and expanding data science
methods for social science research. My research interests include spatial
statistics, Bayesian methods and computation, functional data analysis, and
probabilistic graphical models with applications in environmental and the
social sciences. Julia is my new preferred coding language for machine learning
and statistics. I really enjoy tracking my own fitness with a gps watch and
heart rate monitor and am particularly excited about future avenues of research
in sociology and personalized medicine that incorporate data from wearable
devices.

ðŸ‘€ Currently looking for Postdoc positions related to Bayesian machine
learning, functional data analysis/human mobility studies, or social science
methodology.
